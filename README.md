<b> ## About Me
Cybersecurity practitioner focused on defensive security, threat hunting, and vulnerability management.
I build labs, break systems, analyze telemetry, and document failures until they stop failing.

This repository is a living record of hands-on work across blue team, red team, and infrastructure security.
