# Portfolio Activity: Conduct a security audit, Part 1

## Activity Overview

In part one of this activity, you will conduct an internal security audit, which you can include in your cybersecurity portfolio. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [Create a cybersecurity portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks/resources/pyALD).

As a reminder, audits help ensure that security checks are made, to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization’s business continuity and critical assets. 

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with completed exemplars to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplars until you have completed this activity and answered the questions.

### Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

*This scenario is based on a fictional company:*

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department. 

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist.

### Step 2: Analyze the audit scope, goals, and risk assessment

You receive the following email from your IT manager:

Hello!

I have completed the audit scope and goals, as well as a risk assessment. At a high level, the main goals and risks are as follows:

**Goals:**

Improve Botium Toys’ current security posture by aligning to industry best practices (e.g., adhere to the NIST CSF, implement concept of least permissions)

Provide mitigation recommendations (i.e., controls, policies, documentation), based on current risks

Identify compliance regulations Botium Toys must adhere to, primarily based on where we conduct business and how we accept payments

To review the full report, read the **Botium Toys: Audit scope and goals document**

**Risks:**

Inadequate management of assets

Proper controls are not in place

May not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and guidelines

Current risk score is 8/10 (high), due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance regulations and standards

To review the complete list of assets and risks, read the **Botium Toys: Risk assessment** document 

Thank you,
Botium Toys IT Manager


After you review the audit scope, goals, and risk assessment, consider the following questions:

What are the biggest risks to the organization?

Which controls are most essential to implement immediately versus in the future?

Which compliance regulations does Botium Toys need to adhere to, to ensure the company keeps customer and vendor data safe, avoids fines, etc.?

Then, move on to the next step.

### Step 4: Conduct the audit: Compliance checklist
